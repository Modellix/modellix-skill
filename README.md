# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides seamless integration with the Modellix platform, enabling AI agents to leverage a vast array of over 100 generative AI models. Agents can utilize this skill to perform complex tasks such as generating images and videos from text, editing existing media, translating text within images, and executing virtual try-ons, all through a unified API.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a comprehensive Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform that offers API access to a diverse collection of over 100 AI models from leading providers including Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax. The platform supports a wide range of generative AI capabilities, including:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create high-quality images from text prompts using models like Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, and Seedream series.
*   **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Edit and transform existing images with text prompts, supporting features like style transfer, object manipulation, and color adjustment.
*   **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate videos from text descriptions with cinematic quality using models such as Seedance 1.5 Pro and Wan 2.6 T2V.
*   **Image-to-Video Generation**: Convert static images into dynamic video sequences with motion and animation.
*   **Specialized Image Editing**: Perform advanced tasks like text editing in images (bilingual support), color enhancement, style transfer, object addition/removal, image outpainting, and background generation.
*   **Virtual Try-On and Fashion**: Generate AI virtual try-on effects for clothing applications.
*   **Image Translation**: Translate text within images across multiple languages.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing**: All API calls are asynchronous, returning a `task_id` for status tracking.
*   **Transparent Pricing & Logging**: Clear pricing structures and detailed logging for all operations.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Backed by extensive IT service expertise and robust infrastructure.
