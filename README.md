# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides seamless integration with the Modellix platform, enabling AI agents to leverage a comprehensive suite of over 100 generative AI models. Agents can utilize this skill to perform a wide range of tasks, including image and video generation, image editing, virtual try-ons, and more, all through a unified API.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a unified Model as a Service (MaaS) platform offering API access to a vast collection of generative AI models from leading providers such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax. The platform empowers agents with capabilities including:

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create high-quality images from text prompts using models like Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, and Seedream series.
- **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Edit and transform existing images with text prompts, supporting features like style transfer, object manipulation, and color adjustment.
- **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate cinematic-quality videos from text descriptions using models like Seedance 1.5 Pro and Wan 2.6 T2V.
- **Image-to-Video Generation**: Convert static images into dynamic video sequences with motion and animation.
- **Image Editing Operations**: Perform specialized tasks such as bilingual text editing in images, color enhancement, style transfer, object addition/removal, and background generation.
- **Virtual Try-On and Fashion**: Generate AI virtual try-on effects for clothing and fashion applications.
- **Image Translation**: Translate text within images across multiple languages.
- **Specialized Image Generation**: Create artistic text (Wordart), convert sketches to images, generate backgrounds, and extend images with outpainting.

Modellix supports asynchronous task processing with transparent pricing, detailed logging, and enterprise-grade reliability.
