# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides seamless access to the comprehensive suite of generative AI models offered by Modellix, a unified Model as a Service (MaaS) platform. It empowers AI agents to leverage over 100 advanced AI models for a wide array of creative and analytical tasks, including image and video generation, sophisticated image editing, and specialized applications like virtual try-ons.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a unified AI model API platform that aggregates generative AI models from providers like Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax, supporting a vast range of capabilities:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create high-quality images from text prompts using models such as Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, Seedream series, and others. Supports multiple styles, aspect ratios, and creative parameters.
*   **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Edit and transform existing images using text prompts, including image editing, style transfer, object addition/removal, color adjustment, and detail enhancement.
*   **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate videos from text descriptions with cinematic quality using models like Seedance 1.5 Pro and Wan 2.6 T2V, supporting multi-shot narratives and custom audio.
*   **Image-to-Video Generation**: Convert static images into video sequences with motion and animation using models like Wan 2.6 I2V and Seedance.
*   **Image Editing Operations**: Perform specialized tasks such as bilingual text editing in images, color adjustment, style transfer, object manipulation, image outpainting, and background generation.
*   **Virtual Try-On and Fashion**: Generate AI virtual try-on effects for clothing and fashion applications.
*   **Image Translation**: Translate text within images across 11 languages.
*   **Specialized Image Generation**: Create Wordart, convert sketches to images, generate backgrounds, and extend images with outpainting.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing**: All model API calls are asynchronous, returning a `task_id` for status and result retrieval.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Backed by 15 years of IT service expertise, with transparent pricing, detailed logging, and robust infrastructure.
